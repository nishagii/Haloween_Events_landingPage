          <br />
          On a foggy October night, a small group of Halloween lovers decided to share their passion for the spooky season. What began as a humble neighborhood event has grown into the legendary HallowFest, celebrated far and wide. Our commitment to chills, thrills, and unforgettable experiences keeps the tradition alive.
